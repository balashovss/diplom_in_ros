# diplom_in_ros
## Motivation
* I am post-graduate student of BMSTU and want to make a three-legged-wheeled robot diplom in ROS. Don't look for something good in Robotics, any advices are welcomed. The code now decomposed as shit, because I did it for three-four days I guess from very very zero in ROS and one intensive about Linux and pure C. 
* The motivation of this project was to mix pros of wheeled movement and pros of legged movement in just a cute thing as you see. With three legs I wanted to move up and down stairs and with wheels to move on flat surface.
